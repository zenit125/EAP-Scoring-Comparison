# Abstract {.unnumbered}

The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) uses Item Response Theory (IRT) and Expected A Posteriori (EAP) scoring methods to precisely score measures. EAP scoring is a flexible and accurate form of calculating scale scores using IRT model parameters. This tutorial provides a description and demonstration of the EAP scoring methods as implemented in PROMIS. Extensions and practical considerations of EAP scoring methods are discussed. All statistical examples and demonstration graphics presented in this tutorial are made available through the R Markdown framework. Commented statistical code for calculating EAP scores is included in appendices. 

# Translational Abstract {.unnumbered}

The PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) measurement system was developed to precisely and reliably measure health-related quality of life using the patient’s voice. To achieve these aims, PROMIS utilized Item Response Theory (IRT) methods in its development, validation and implementation. PROMIS uses a specific method to calculate scores, called Expected A Posteriori (EAP) scoring. EAP scoring methods are flexible, produce accurate scores and can be efficiently calculated by statistical software. This tutorial seeks to make EAP scoring methods transparent and accessible to larger audience through description, graphical demonstration and examples. Further applications and practical considerations of EAP scoring are presented and discussed. All materials used in this tutorial are made available through the R Markdown reproducibility framework and are intended to reviewed and reused. Commented statistical code for the calculation of EAP scores is included.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS^®^), @Cella2010PROMIS, is a disease-agnostic measurement system of health-related quality of life which utilizes Item Response Theory (IRT). PROMIS was originally created to leverage the benefits of IRT and Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) to minimize patient response burden while maximizing measurement reliability. PROMIS measures have been shown to be reliable, valid and accurate in a variety of conditions and contexts [@SchaletB2016CvoP; @CookK2016Pmop; @SchaletB2016VoPp; @AskewR2016CVoP; @CellaD2016PFIB; @Hahn2016TPsw]. Over the past fifteen years, there has been substantial development, adoption and implementation of PROMIS [@Reeve2007PROMISPsychm; @Stover2019PRO]. Such efforts have leveraged IRT to increase the accessibility of and aid their interpretation, including T-score maps [@Rothrock2020TscoreMaps] and "linking" between non-PROMIS and PROMIS measures [@Choi2014DepLink].

However, despite its broad user base among clinicians and researchers and its recognition among regulators, the IRT scoring methods used in PROMIS are not well understood by the average user.

This tutorial aims to make PROMIS IRT scoring methods accessible to all users by supplementing foundational psychometric literature with non-technical descriptions and illustrative graphics. To the same end, this tutorial was created in the reproducibility framework of R Markdown [@RMarkdown]. An R Markdown document (.rmd) contains both commented  statistical code and the explanatory text in this document. Both the text and statistical code for scoring is intended to be reviewed and implemented by the reader. Included in the appendices of this tutorial are a set of annotated statistical programming scripts for scoring PROMIS measures.

# IRT Foundations {.unnumbered}

The IRT methods employed in PROMIS were developed 40-50 years ago [@Samejima1969; @Lord1984RSSS; @Bock1982EAP] and have been used extensively in the educational field. Over the past two decades, researchers have also shown how IRT can be applied to patient-centered outcomes generally [@Nguyen2014IRTPCO; @ReeveFayers2005IRT] and documented how IRT has been applied in PROMIS specifically [@Reeve2007PROMISPsychm; @Stover2019PRO]. This tutorial only briefly reviews foundations of IRT in PROMIS and instead provides focused demonstration of PROMIS scoring methods.

## Response Probabilities {.unnumbered}  
### Building Block of IRT Scoring {.unnumbered}  
IRT ranks individuals and their responses to survey items across a latent trait, such as fatigue. Just as two different people might have different levels of fatigue, two different responses to a survey item relate to two different levels of fatigue. However, unlike many physiological traits and states (e.g., presence or absence of a cancerous tumor), a latent trait can’t be directly measured with objective indicators [@APADictionary]. Instead, IRT allows us to infer where an individual most likely ranks on a latent trait continuum. The inference of where an individual ranks on a latent trait is made by transforming an individuals response to an item (e.g., *I feel tired* - *Never*, *Sometimes*, and *Always*) to a set of probabilities across all levels of the latent trait. Each probability in the set represents the likelihood that an individual who endorses a specific response option has a particular level of latent trait. Expected A Posteriori scoring reduces these probability sets to a single point-estimate of the latent trait (i.e., a score) and provides an estimate of variability and reliability of the point estimate of the latent trait (i.e., standard deviation or standard error).

Two things are required to calculate these probabilities for a PROMIS measure: item calibration statistics, such as those shown in Table \@ref(tab:TableOfCalibrations), and the graded response model formula shown in Formula \@ref(eq:Probability). The formula allows a mathematical transformation of an individual's response to an item to a set of probabilities across the spectrum of the latent trait. The graded response model formula is the companion equation for interpreting PROMIS item calibration statistics and calculating probabilities. The graded response model was originally published by @Samejima1969, but is explained in more accessible terms by Reeve, Chang and Fayers [@ReeveFayers2005IRT; @Chang2005IRT].

In Formula \@ref(eq:Probability) we can see the calibration statistics, annotated as "discrimination" and "threshold". Each item has one discrimination calibration statistic and a number of threshold calibration statistics equal to the number of response options minus one. An example is PROMIS Fatigue item FATEXP42 (*In the past 7 days, how much mental energy did you have on average?*) which has five response options (*Not at all*, *A little bit*, *Somewhat*, *Quite a bit*, and *Very much*). It follows that FATEXP42 has one discrimination calibration statistic (abbreviated "a"), and four threshold calibration statistics (abbreviated and numbered from "cb1" to "cb4"). The item calibrations for FATEXP42 were originally published in Figure 3 of @Gershon2010AC and are provided here in Table \@ref(tab:TableOfCalibrations) for reference.

The remaining undefined variable in Formula \@ref(eq:Probability) is "theta", which refers to the latent trait being measured (e.g., fatigue or physical functioning). Theta is actualized as a single number for an individual level of latent trait, ranging from negative infinity to infinity. For the purposes of scoring and interpreting PROMIS measures, the range of theta is limited to ±4, with a higher theta relating to more of what is being measured measured, e.g., higher PROMIS Fatigue theta values relate to more fatigue or higher PROMIS Physical Function theta values relate to better physical functioning.

\begin{equation}
Probability =
{ \frac{1} {1+e^{-1*discrimination(theta-threshold)}} } 
(\#eq:Probability)
\end{equation}


```{r TableOfCalibrations}
# This R Markdown chunk creates a Kable table of item calibration statistics from PROMIS Fatigue item FATEXP42
knitr::kable(round(Items$Fatigue$FATEXP42$Calibrations,2), caption="IRT Calibration Statistics for PROMIS Fatigue item FATEXP42")
```

Once we evaluate Formula \@ref(eq:Probability) for all levels of theta (e.g., -4 to 4) and for all item calibrations statistics provided in Table \@ref(tab:TableOfCalibrations), we can create a set of probability curves that represent each item's response options. Figure \@ref(fig:FATEXP42ItemCharacteristicCurves) shows an example of how the response options of FATEXP42 are ordered across level of theta (level of fatigue), with response option *Not at all* having higher probabilities at lower levels of theta (lower fatigue), and response option *Very much* having higher probabilities at higher levels of theta (higher fatigue).

This tutorial demonstrates how PROMIS measures are scored using graphical representations of probability curves, such as those in Figure \@ref(fig:FATEXP42ItemCharacteristicCurves). To aid interpretation, these probability curves are plotted with consistent formatting styles, detailed in Table \@ref(tab:TableOfLineColors). All response option probability curves are plotted with a dotted, dashed or dash-dotted line. The first and second threshold probability curves are plotted with different colored solid lines. The prior and posterior probability curves are plotted with different colored and weighted solid lines. All colors used in figures were selected from the *colorBlindness* package in R by @colorBlindness.

Figure \@ref(fig:PlotProbPFA51) uses PROMIS Physical Function item PFA51 (*Are you able to sit on the edge of a bed?*) to provide a more detailed example of how Formula \@ref(eq:Probability) and item calibration statistics can be used to generate a set of probabilities and plot what are referred to as item characteristic curves. The top two graphs of Figure \@ref(fig:PlotProbPFA51) show the probability curves associated with the first two thresholds. The first threshold, cb1, is represented by a solid yellow line orange line and the second threshold, cb2, is represented by a solid dark green line.  

The center left plot of Figure \@ref(fig:PlotProbPFA51) shows how a single probability curve (dotted blue line) can be calculated by subtracting the first threshold (cb1, yellow line) from the second threshold (cb2, solid dark green line). At the theta level of -3.3 the probability difference between first threshold (cb1, solid yellow line) and second threshold (cb2, solid dark green line) is 0.36 and the probability of an individual with -3.3 level of physical functioning selecting the second response option (dotted blue line) is 0.36. The calculated dotted blue probability curve represents the probability of an individual selecting the second response option of PFA51 (*With much difficulty*) across the spectrum of physical functioning (theta).

The center right plot of Figure \@ref(fig:PlotProbPFA51) shows how the probability curves for the two extreme response categories, *Without any difficulty* and *Unable to do*, are calculated by subtracting the lowest threshold (cb1) probabilities from 1 and subtracting the highest threshold (cb4) probabilities by 0. Subtracting the highest and lowest thresholds by 1 and 0 anchors the extreme response option probabilities at their limits, either certainty (1) or impossibility (0). Subtracting the lowest threshold (cb1, solid yellow line) by 1 'flips' the probabilities to create the first response option (*Unable to do*)  probability curve, represented by a dashed purple line. Subtracting the highest threshold (cb4, pink line) by 0 means that the probabilities of the response option associated with the highest level of theta (*Without any difficulty*) are the same as the response probabilities of the highest threshold (cb4). The dot-dashed pink line represents both cb4 threshold probabilities and *Without any difficulty* response option probabilities.  

The plot at the bottom of Figure \@ref(fig:PlotProbPFA51) shows the probability curves for all five response options of PFA51. The calibration statistics for PFA51 and other PROMIS Physical Function items mentioned in this work can be found in the first Table of @Rose2014PF. These response option probabilities are the building blocks of IRT scoring in PROMIS.

# Expected A Posteriori Scoring {.unnumbered}

## How Do We Go From IRT Probabilities to Scores? {.unnumbered}

IRT provides a probability-based model which is very useful for the quantitative evaluation of item- and scale-level characteristics in survey development, but we can also use IRT to find a point estimate of an individual's position on the theta spectrum. In other words, we can score individuals on the latent trait. PROMIS scores are reported on the "T-score" metric, which is a linear transformation of theta, as shown in Formula \@ref(eq:Tscore). This tutorial reports scores as either theta or T-scores, with the understanding that they are linearly related. 

\begin{equation}
T-score = (theta*10)+50
(\#eq:Tscore)
\end{equation}

```{r RespCatProbThetaSecondOnlyCalc}

 # This R Markdown chunk find the maximum probability and the probabilities associated with the second response option "A little bit" 
  # of Fatigue item FATEXP42. The pp object with response option probabilities is reused from a previous example,
  # coded and referenced above. This is broken out from the graph so that it maxprob and maxprob theta can be referenced
  # in the text, see `r maxprobtheta` below.
    
    # maxprob: max probability of the second response of FATEXP42
      maxprob=max(pp[,"FATEXP42","A little bit"])

    # maxprobtheta: the theta associated with the maximum probability point of the second response of FATEXP42 
      maxprobtheta=as.numeric(dimnames(pp)[[1]][[which.max(pp[,"FATEXP42","A little bit"])]])
    
    # maxprobthetaindex: the theta quadrature 'index' (1:81) related to maxprobtheta 
      maxprobthetaindex=which(names(pp[,"FATEXP42","A little bit"])==maxprobtheta)

```


As a score calculation example, we will again use PROMIS Fatigue item FATEXP42 (*In the past 7 days, how much mental energy did you have on average?*).
See item response option probability curve for the second response option (*A little bit*) in Figure \@ref(fig:RespCatProbThetaSecondOnly).
A logical IRT score is the most probable level of theta, also known as the maximum likelihood of theta.
Using this method, an individual that selected the second response option of FATEXP42 would be assigned a maximum likelihood score of `r maxprobtheta` or T-score of `r (maxprobtheta*10+50)`, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:RespCatProbThetaSecondOnly).

This simple example has two problems, however.
The first problem comes from a practical issue in measurement and the second stems from mathematical limitations.
The practical measurement issue occurs when respondents select the absolute highest or lowest response option in an item (e.g., *Never* or *Always*). Using another fatigue item as an example, in FATEXP29 (*In the past 7 days, how often did you feel totally drained?*) the extreme response of *Never* is likely selected by people with very different experiences of fatigue: *Never* would be selected a respondent with low-level fatigue (e.g., feels slightly, but not totally drained over the past week), *Never* would be selected by a respondent who didn't experience fatigue (e.g., didn't feel drained at all over the past week) and *Never* would be selected by a respondent who had an unusually high energy over the past week. While the extreme response option of *Never* is selected by all three respondents for this item, we can be more certain that respondents with even less fatigue (or more energy) are increasingly likely to pick the *Never* response option.  

This is also true for the other extreme response option, *Always*. A response of *Always* is likely to be selected by a respondent who just had a totally draining week, by a respondent who had a totally draining month, or by a respondent who had a totally draining year. The inability of an item or scale to distinguish between extreme levels is a measurement property known as the "floor" and "ceiling" effect, @APADictionary. The response probability curves of the extreme responses options show these floor and ceiling effects (Figure \@ref(fig:RespCatProbThetaExtremeOnly)). Probabilities of these extreme responses categories are monotonic, meaning they have a constantly increasing probability of being selected with increasingly extreme levels of theta, and there is no single point of maximum likelihood for us to use as a score.   

The second problem related to mathematical limitations is the infinite space that we assume exists for the latent trait. All response option probability curves are asymptotic, meaning the probability curves expand over an infinite range of theta and never reach probability values of either 0 or 1. It is mathematically complex and computationally costly to perform calculations in an infinite space.

```{r RespCatProbThetaExtremeOnly, dev="png", fig.path="Figures/", fig.cap="Response option probabilities across theta for PROMIS Fatigue item FATEXP42, *Not at all* and *Very much* extreme responses options only", fig.width=3, fig.height=3, dpi=200}

```


To solve these two problems, we use a scoring mechanism called "Expected A Posteriori" (EAP) scoring, [@Bock1982EAP; @Bock1981MMLE]. This form of scoring works by imposing constraints on how we calculate probabilities.
The first constraint comes from limiting the infinite theta space to a "quadrature", which can be visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:ThetaQuadratureLine) as a set of evenly spaced points on a number line or x axis between two bounds.
PROMIS uses boundaries of -4 theta to 4 theta or (T-scores of 10-90), with 0.1 theta increments (1 T-score point).
This quadrature was carefully chosen to cover the overwhelming majority of respondents: theta can be interpreted as standard deviations of the population, and we can assume that a range of -4 to 4 theta encompasses 99.994% of people.
As will be demonstrated later, the quadrature allows us to use simple multiplication instead of integral calculus to obtain a maximum likelihood point estimate of our probability sets.

```{r ThetaQuadratureLine, dev="png", fig.path="Figures/", fig.cap="Theta quadrature as number line", fig.width=8, fig.height=2.5, dpi=200}

# This R Markdown chunk plots the theta quadrature as a number line 

# Create an empty plotting space
  plot(NA, type="n",xaxt="n", yaxt="n", xlab="", ylab="", bty="n", 
       ylim=c(-0.85,0.25), xlim=c(min(theta)-1,max(theta)+1), mar=c(0,0,0,0))

# Draw an double ended arrow
  arrows(y0=0,y1=0,x0=min(theta)-1,x1=max(theta)+1, code=3, length = 0.175)

# Cycle through every increment, "i" in the theta quadrature "theta"...
  for(i in theta){
      # draw major tick marks at quarter increments of theta
        if(!i%%0.5){segments(y0=-0.25,y1=0.25,x0=i,x1=i)}
      # draw minor tick marks at every other increment of theta
        else{segments(y0=-0.1,y1=0.1,x0=i,x1=i)}
      # insert theta numbers at whole numbers of theta
        if(!i%%1){text(i,-0.75,i,family="Times New Roman")}}
  
# insert infinity and negative infinity symbols at the extremities of the number line
  text( min(theta)-0.7,-0.8,expression(-infinity), cex=1.75, family="Times New Roman")
  text( max(theta)+0.9,-0.75,expression(infinity), cex=1.75, family="Times New Roman")

```

The quadrature does not alleviate all of the problems of maximum likelihood scoring with extreme responses, however. The quadrature stops the constant growth of the extreme response option's probability curve at its limits (-4 to 4), which means that an extreme response option's 'maximum likelihood' theta score will be tied to the quadrature limits. Expanding or shrinking the limits of the quadrature (e.g., -6 to 6 or -2 to 2) will increase or decrease the scores of extreme response options, which is a validity problem for scores. An individual could receive different theta scores unrelated any real difference in the latent trait.   

EAP scoring uses a "prior" in the calculation of scores to address this problem.
Generally, a prior is a bayesian concept that refers to our best guess of an individual's theta score before they've selected a response option, @APADictionary. The EAP scoring prior used in PROMIS is a normal distribution which reflects the population mean (μ=0) and standard deviation (σ=1). It is a reasonable assumption that any individual is a member of the population.

After multiplication by the prior probability curve, the extreme response probability curve is reshaped, repositioned and called the "posterior probability". The new posterior probability curve is pulled back from the quadrature limit and is no longer monotonic: instead it looks like the normal curve of the prior. The amount of the lateral repositioning of the posterior (and movement of the maximum likelihood score) away from the quadrature limit is a function of the area under the curve of the original extreme response option probability and the area under the curve of the prior.

Figure \@ref(fig:RespCatProbThetaExtremePriorwMath) shows a graphical example of the new posterior curve. In Figure 6, the dashed purple line represents the response probabilities from FATEXP42’s extreme response option (*Not at all*), the solid green line represents the prior probability curve, and the bold solid orange line represents the new posterior probability curve with a maximum probability of -0.87. The posterior (bold solid orange) can be visualized as 'splitting the difference' between the probability curves of the extreme response option (dashed purple) and the prior (solid green).

The bottom half of Figure \@ref(fig:RespCatProbThetaExtremePriorwMath) shows the calculation of the posterior probability curve.
At each increment on the theta quadrature ( `r minTheta` to `r maxTheta` by increments of `r inc`), the response option probability is multiplied by the prior probability.
For example, at a theta of -1, the response probability of `r round(pp[which(as.numeric(dimnames(pp)[[1]])==-1),1,"Not at all"],3)` is multiplied by a prior probability of `r round(prior[which(as.numeric(dimnames(pp)[[1]])==-1)],3)` , which equals a posterior probability of `r round(posterior[which(as.numeric(dimnames(pp)[[1]])==-1)],3)`.
The size of the posterior probabilies are shrunk due to the multiplication of decimals, but we are only concerned with the location of the maximum likelihood point estimate that we'll use as an EAP score. Without the theta quadrature, integral calculus would be required to multiply the prior and the response option probability curves.

Figure \@ref(fig:ThetaCalcPosteriorProbMath) further demonstrates the method for calculating a single theta score from posterior probabilities across the theta quadrature.
The quadrature again allows us to use simple multiplication in lieu of calculus, by multiplying posterior probabilities at each theta increment by their corresponding theta level to create a set of theta weighted posterior probabilities, e.g., theta of -2 multiplied by a posterior probability of `r round(posterior["-2"],3)` equals a weighted probability of `r round(posterior["-2"],3)*-2`. Dividing the sum of the weighted posterior probabilities (`r round(sum(thetaweightedposterior),2)`) by the sum of the posterior probabilities (`r round(sum(posterior),2)`) gives us the final theta estimate (`r round(sum(thetaweightedposterior)/sum(posterior),2)`).

We originally introduced the prior into the scoring calculation in order to circumvent problems with extreme responses. However, in order to make sure that scores from all response options (extreme or not) are comparable, the prior is used in calculating all scores. This is also true for scores calculated from multiple items.  

To calculate a single score from an individuals’ responses to multiple items, we combine the probability curves through multiplication. This operation is analogous to calculating the joint probability of two independent events, e.g., the probability of obtaining two heads from two coin flips is calculated as 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25. 

In calculating a score from multiple items, we multiply all response probabilities together, and then multiply by the prior to generate a set of single set of posterior probabilities, as in Figure \@ref(fig:MultiScoring) below. Figure \@ref(fig:MultiScoring) uses two response options probabilities from PROMIS Physical Function items PFA56 (*Are you able to get in and out of a car?*) and PFC46 (*Are you able to transfer from a bed to a chair and back?*). The probabilities in the graph of Figure \@ref(fig:MultiScoring) are scaled to make the posterior probability curve more visible. The dashed purple line represents the scaled response probabilities for extreme response option of PFC46, *Unable to do* and the dot-dashed brown line represents the scaled response probabilities of PFA56, *With some difficulty*. The solid green line represents the scaled prior probabilities and bold solid orange line represents the scaled probabilities of the posterior.  The process for calculating a single theta score from multiple items is the same as in the single item example in Figure \@ref(fig:ThetaCalcPosteriorProbMath).

## Practical Considerations of EAP Scoring {.unnumbered}

There are three practical considerations of EAP scoring: one consideration related to the ordering of items, one related to score resolution, and another related the bias of prior.

Figure \@ref(fig:MultiScoring) shows that EAP scoring uses simple multiplication to combine probabilities of multiple items.  A property of multiplication is that any order or arrangement of multiplications has the same result (e.g., 1x2x3 = 3x2x1).
Consequently, the order of items doesn't matter in EAP score calculation; a combination of item responses in any order will result in the same score.

The insensitivity to item order also means that the resolution of EAP scores increases exponentially with the number items answered. One item with five response options has 5 possible EAP scores (5^1^=5), two items have 25 possible EAP scores (5^2^=25) and three items have 125 possible EAP scores (5^3^=125). This is a large increase in score resolution over raw sum scoring methods, in which the same three items have only 13 possible sum scores, ranging from 3-15.

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:RespCatProbThetaExtremePriorwMath), multiplication by the prior biases an EAP score inward.
However, since the prior is only multiplied once in calculation of the posterior, it's influence on the final EAP score will shrink as more items added into the calculation.

For these reasons, this tutorial doesn’t recommend EAP scoring with fewer than 3 items. The shortest PROMIS short form has 4 items and PROMIS CAT will administer 4 items as the standard minimum.

# Raw Sum Score to IRT Look-up Table Scoring {.unnumbered}

The previous sections demonstrate that Expected A Posteriori scoring is flexible and can be efficiently calculated by computers, but requires both statistical coding and calibration statistics to generate scores from item responses. An alternative for PROMIS users who do not have access to calibration statistics and statistical code is a "look-up" table to convert a raw sum score to an EAP score. The scores in these look-up tables are calculated with EAP methods and represent the most probable theta level across all possible response pattern combinations for a single scale-level sum score. The maximum and minimum scale-level scores in the table relate to the floor and ceiling of the scale. Table \@ref(tab:LookUpTable) shows an example look-up table. 

Figure \@ref(fig:LookUpTableGraph) shows an example of how an EAP score for a raw sum score of 4 in Table \@ref(tab:LookUpTable) is calculated. In this example, three Physical Function items (PFA51, PFB25 and PFC46) make up a three-item scale. The minimum possible scale score on the three item scale is 3 (all three items have a raw score of 1) and maximum scale score of 15 (all three items have a raw score of 5), as shown in Table \@ref(tab:LookUpTable).

To calculate the EAP score for a scale-level raw sum score of 4, we first calculate the theta probabilities for each of the three possible combinations that sum to 4. Each response combination includes two 1's and one 2, i.e., 1,1,2; 1,2,1; 2,1,1. Each of the response probability curves are shown in the top three plots of Figure \@ref(fig:LookUpTableGraph). The total probability of multiple independent events (or in this case, three independent response patterns which each have a sum-score of 4) can be found by summation, shown in bottom of Figure \@ref(fig:LookUpTableGraph). The center plot in Figure \@ref(fig:LookUpTableGraph) shows each scaled probability curves, including the three dotted, dashed and dot-dashed response pattern probability curves, and their sum multiplied by the prior. The result is a posterior probability curve (bold solid orange line) with a theta maximum likelihood of -3.36 for all response combinations which sum to 4.

In order to differentiate between the two forms of scoring, one is referred to as "response pattern scoring" or "pattern response scoring" because it uses an individual's pattern of responses and the other is referred to as "look-up table scoring". Scores calculated for a look-up table are typically very highly correlated (e.g., \>0.9) with response pattern scoring. Figure \@ref(fig:LookUpPatternResponseScoreCorrelation) shows a plot of look-up and pattern response scoring methods for all response option combinations of the three physical function items used in Table \@ref(tab:LookUpTable) and Figure \@ref(fig:LookUpTableGraph). The two scoring methods have a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96. For this reason, the scores from these two scoring methods are considered to be interchangeable, as mentioned in @Hanmer2020Checklist. Pattern response scoring methods are more sensitive to an individual's pattern of responses and are recommended whenever possible, but look-up table scoring is a good alternative. Foundational citations and additional examples of look-up table scoring methods are published in @Cai2015RSSS and  @Lord1984RSSS.

# Posterior Standard Deviation and Standard Error {.unnumbered}

Because of the inclusion of the prior in estimating the theta score, EAP scores don't have a traditional standard error. Instead, we can calculate the standard deviation of the posterior distribution. The method for calculating the posterior standard deviation is the same for both pattern-response and look-up table scoring methods. Formula \@ref(eq:PosteriorSD) details the calculation of the posterior standard deviation.  

There are parallels between the posterior standard deviation and the common standard deviation formula \@ref(eq:SD), notably, the size of the numerator of both formulas is driven by the sum of squared deviations from a single point, either the EAP score in Formula \@ref(eq:PosteriorSD) or the mean in Formula \@ref(eq:SD) and both Formulas use a square root. They differ in that the squared deviation at each level of the theta quadrature is multiplied by the posterior probability before summation in Formula \@ref(eq:PosteriorSD), and that the sum of the posterior distribution is the denominator in Formula \@ref(eq:PosteriorSD) and the sample size is in the denominator of Formula \@ref(eq:SD).


\begin{equation}
Posterior\:SD ={\sqrt{ \frac{\sum(Posterior*(Theta\:Quadrature-EAP\:Score)^2)} {\sum(Posterior)} }}
(\#eq:PosteriorSD)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
SD= {\sqrt{\frac{\sum(X-\bar{X})^2}{N}}}
(\#eq:SD)
\end{equation}

While the posterior standard deviation is not a standard error, it is related in a number of ways. The posterior standard deviation is a function of the shape of the posterior probability curve, which is informed by the consistency of response probabilities and the number of items scored.  

Figure \@ref(fig:PosteriorStandardDeviationPlot) shows an example of the relationship between number of items, consistency of responses and the posterior standard deviation. The gray shaded area under the bold solid orange posterior probability curve in Figure \@ref(fig:PosteriorStandardDeviationPlot) indicates a bandwidth of one standard deviation from the EAP score. Generally, a smaller posterior standard deviation occurs with a larger number of items with consistent responses, which maps onto a smaller standard error. Conversely, a smaller number of inconsistent item responses leads to a larger posterior standard deviation and larger standard error. @Bock1982EAP draw a direct and "near identity" relationship between the posterior standard deviation and standard error as the number of items increases (p. 437).

Similar to how T-scores are a linear transformation of theta (Formula \@ref(eq:Tscore)), posterior standard deviations can be put on the T-score metric by multiplication by 10, e.g., a posterior standard deviation of 0.21 on the theta metric is a posterior standard deviation of 2.1 on the T-score metric.

# Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Expected A Posteriori (EAP) scoring is a flexible and efficient scoring method that can be performed without complex calculations and can be visualized and logically explained. Item response option probabilities distributed across a latent trait spectrum, theta, are the building blocks of EAP scoring and the maximum likelihood of these probabilities can provide a score estimate. Introduction of a theta quadrature and a Bayesian "prior" simplifies complex mathematical operations and alleviates measurement problems. For users who don't have access to the statistical code and item calibration statistics, a scale-level raw sum score to EAP score look-up table can be calculated. A posterior standard deviation can be calculated for all EAP scoring methods, which reflects the score standard error. A more complete understanding of the operation and options in PROMIS EAP scoring will help ground PROMIS IRT methods with existing users and will support the further adoption and implementation of PROMIS among researchers, clinicians and regulators.
